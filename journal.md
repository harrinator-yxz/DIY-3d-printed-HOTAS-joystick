### June 8th: Project startup

I started this project by just looking for some files and resources to get started.
I found:

- The [Olukelo gimbal](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2496028)
- The [Real Robots Modular Joystick](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4732811)
- [F-16 Sidestick Grip](https://www.printables.com/model/233472-f-16-sidestick-grip) By [Spock](https://www.printables.com/@Spock) On [printables.com](Printables)
- [Freejoy](https://github.com/FreeJoy-Team/FreeJoy)
  

along with multiple other videos about DIY Hotas's and even a [Reddit Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotasDIY/)




**Total time spent: 4h**

### June 10th: Deciding on parts

I decided to use the [Real Robots Modular Joystick](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4732811) For my Gimbal. I also decided to slighly modify this for my purpose and for easier recreation.
The first modification was creating a hole through the joystick stick that connects all the mechanical proccess to the stick above There is already

### June 11th: parts

I spent today just deciding what parts to use. For the buttons I was looking at 7mm momentary push buttons. I just decided on these because I couldnt be bothered finding 5 way or 4 way buttons. Also I ordered these just from temu just because they were cheap lol.    I spent most of today downloading and installing 



### June 19th;  Multiple days work 

AFter printing the gimbal i found many flaws but i stuck with it and for the next week I tryed to get it working, after it braking wiht just 2 practice movements i knew something had to be changed.

Today i have started designing my own gimbal. The plane for this is:
 - 3 Axis - with twist rudder controlss:
 - easy to assemble
 - Cheaop
 - Hall effect sensors for greater accuracy.

So far I only have the first axis done. IT uses 688zz ball bearings along with a simple design. I am hopinh to build on this in the future.

***Total time spent last few days: 7h***


### June20th; Deciding on readings

I decided to use halle ffect sensors, i spent most of today just designing how I was going to mount them to the gimbal. The way i have come up with allows for adustment and easy maintenecce. I also imported the f16 sidestick grip as a refrence by spock. I hope to get the second axis done by the end of the week.
